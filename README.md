# JPY-Converter
  ## Description
  JPY Converter pulls exchange rate data from USD and JPY, and allows users to enter prices in either
  currency to compare the equivalent price in the matching pair.  Intended as a simple travel aid,
  JPY converter is not meant to be 100% accurate up to the second or less, and rather approximates the
  prices so travelers can get a rough estimate of the costs of goods and services.
